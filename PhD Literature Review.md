# Topic: Parallel scalable neural network algorithms
## Types of nueral networks
1. "Traditional" （synchronized, value-based, graduatedescent, backpropagation）  
2. Simulating (synchronized, spike-based)  
3. "Rare" (Unsynchronized, value-based)  
4. Neuromorphic (unsynchronized, spike-based)

The "traditional" networks are capable of pure parallel computing, but the neurons must be very complex and two-way communications are needed for links between layers.

-----------------------------------------
## To do
1. Time complexity of centralized and parallel networks
2. Why layered. Are there any other feasible topological structures?
